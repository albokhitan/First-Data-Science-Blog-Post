* **1. Business Understanding** : The objective is to understand the developers salaries for two areas and the factor that impact them based on the Stackoverflow developer 2017 survey that could be found in : Stack Overflow data from 2017

* **2. Data Understanding** : Will utilize Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results, primarly survey_results_public.csv. I have propsed 3 questions that will be asked below to better understand the data.

* **3. Prepare Data**: Only need to keep and condense necessry columns for a dataframe plus handle use of NaN values.

* **4. Data Modeling**: Will utlize tables and graphs.

* **5. Evaluate the Results**: Results will be noted in this notebook but also in the blog post.


## 1. Business Understanding
For this project we will try to find out the below observations:

* Salary comparison between Asian and European.
* Salary comparison with respect to education level.
* Finally find out salary growth with respect to job experience.

First of all we we import all of necessary libraries.
We read the data as it will be a general view with necessary information.

## 3. Prepare Data: 
Only need to keep and condense necessry columns for a dataframe plus handle use of NaN values.

## 4. Data Modeling: 
Will utlize tables and graphs.

## 5. Evaluate the Results:{Results}
Results will be noted in this notebook but also in the blog post.
